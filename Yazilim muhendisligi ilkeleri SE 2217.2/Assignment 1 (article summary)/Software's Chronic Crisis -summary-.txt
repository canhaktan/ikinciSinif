In article "In Software's Chronic Crisis" published in Scientific American in September 1994 talks about the challenges and problems related to the software development industry for those projects that are mentioned. The article highlights the challenges and problems faced in the software development industry. 
The article highlights the complexity of a project can be underestimated, in addition to that complexity of a project can grow increasingly which causes serious delays in finishing the project and sometimes causes cancellation of the whole project. The article also tells us the wrong cost and time estimating is also a problem for software development because projects may finish but the time and money spent on the project can be much much higher than the planned time and cost. The article mentions that the human factor is also a huge thing about software development because a good software engineer in a team can detect or even predict some of the bugs in the software and help the project be a success while a bad software engineer who doesn't knows what to do when he or she does not predict any of bug or panics when he or she sees a bug in the software which can lead chaos in project from the software development.  For solutions to those problems, the article points out that new approaches and improved methodology are necessary to help the project become successful.
Overall, the article points out that improvements in approaching problems, and human factors are necessary to addressing the issues. In addition to the article, I can say that those challenges that were faced back in time are still relevant today and will be relevant in the near future, for now.
